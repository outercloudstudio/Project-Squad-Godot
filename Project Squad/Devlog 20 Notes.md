## *Worldgen was redone to be a mechanic rather than a container for the mechanics*
## Introduction
Worlds don't just have to contain game play. In video games, worlds can be their own game mechanic. Over the last two months I made a new world generator for my game, and I've got some design bits to show you. Be careful, this might get those thinking cogs in your brain spinning.
## The Overall Issue
First, it's important where I came from before we can appreciate some of the decisions that went into the new world gen. 
- the world was made of rooms
- each room would include an enemy encounter before allowing the players to pass
- the rooms would always go up with the occasional turn left and right
- this has a few issues
- the world was very repetitive
- it offered no player agency / choice
- the world in no way interacted with any of the other game mechanics
## Addressing and Resolving Issues
- go to the core of giving player's choice
- I think this is the key to turning an idea into an interesting mechanic
- especially if these ideas are risk and reward
- the most natural choice a world can have is branching paths
- that's exactly what I did
- but, branching paths doesn't necessarily make the choices interesting, or integrate with other mechanics
- Like, I mentioned earlier, I think making decisions risk and reward is fun
- So, I could do this by making taking side paths increase the difficulty of future rooms
- each new room you clear makes future rooms more difficult
- but to make up for this, you'll be able to find loot like new weapons and powerups at the end of these optional branches
- what I've described so far does address the three core issues with the previous world gen
- the new world gen now offers a risk and reward choice that integrates other game mechanics like loot
- this choice as well as the world no longer just going upwards, definitely makes it more interesting, and thankfully a few of the playtesters from my friends and my discord server agree.
- The new world gen is not without issues though.
- At the moment, when you come across a branch, there's no way to tell which is the main path or not 
- I've thought of maybe adding paths on the floor along the main route, but if you have any other ideas, please let me know
## Conclusion
- If you've made it this far I can tell you're probably pretty interested in game design. So if you want to test everything I've talked about so far, join the discord and let me know, I'll send you a build of the game. Thank you for watching, make sure to go grab yourself a nice glass of orange juice, and if you ever give me privilege of your audience again, I'll see you in the next one. Bye.
